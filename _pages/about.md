I have a specific interest in the effects of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems, in particular quantifying the effects of microplastic contamination on organisms. I strongly believe that scientists must collaborate and merge environmental outreach and education with their research in order to make positive change regarding environmental issues. Experience to date demonstrates a commitment to scientific research, alongside teaching and learning in higher education.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
