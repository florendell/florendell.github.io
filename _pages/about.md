I am a Lecturer in Environmental Pollution at The University of Stirling, teaching on Environmental Policy and Management, Global Environmental Issues, Sustainable Development and Environmental Hazards. Alongside this role I am in the final stages of a NERC IAPETUS funded PhD investigating the occurrence and impacts of microplastic contamination on threatened lamprey populations in Scotland.

I have a specific interest in the effects of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems, in particular quantifying the effects of microplastic contamination on organisms. I strongly believe that scientists must collaborate and merge environmental outreach and education with their research in order to make positive change regarding environmental issues. Experience to date demonstrates a commitment to scientific research, alongside teaching and learning in higher education.

My main research interests are in understanding the extent and impacts of microplastic pollution of freshwater biota, in particular documenting the uptake of microplastics from the environment into lamprey larvae, an important and protected fish species. My previous research includes documenting the developmental toxicity of microplastic leachates on Sea Urchin Larvae. My research and laboratory skills lie in spectral analysis of synthetic particles, isolating microplastics from complex organic matrices and animal husbandry. I am an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and have worked closely with teaching students alongside my research.
