I am currently a Teaching Fellow on the MSc Biodiversity, Wildlife and Ecosystem Health at the Univeristy of Edinbrugh. Prior to this I was a Lecturer in Environmental Pollution at The University of Stirling. I have completed a a NERC IAPETUS funded PhD investigating the occurrence and impacts of microplastic contamination on threatened lamprey populations in Scotland.

I am an ecotoxicologist with a specific interest in the effects of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems, in particular quantifying the effects of microplastic contamination on organisms. I strongly believe that scientists must collaborate and merge environmental outreach and education with their research in order to make positive change regarding environmental issues. Experience to date demonstrates a commitment to scientific research, alongside teaching and learning in higher education.
