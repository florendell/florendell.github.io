I am a Lecturer in Environmental Pollution at The University of Stirling, teaching on Environmental Policy and Management, Global Environmental Issues, Sustainable Development and Environmental Hazards. Alongside this role I am in the final stages of a NERC IAPETUS funded PhD investigating the occurrence and impacts of microplastic contamination on threatened lamprey populations in Scotland.

I have a specific interest in the effects of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems, in particular quantifying the effects of microplastic contamination on organisms. I strongly believe that scientists must collaborate and merge environmental outreach and education with their research in order to make positive change regarding environmental issues. Experience to date demonstrates a commitment to scientific research, alongside teaching and learning in higher education.
