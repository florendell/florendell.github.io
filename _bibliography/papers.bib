  abstract={Microplastic pollution has become ubiquitous, affecting a wide variety of biota. Although microplastics are known to alter the development of a range of marine invertebrates, no studies provide a detailed morphological characterisation of the developmental defects. Likewise, the developmental toxicity of chemicals leached from plastic particles is understudied. The consequences of these developmental effects are likely underestimated, and the effects on ecosystems are unknown. Using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as a model, we studied the effects of leachates of three forms of plastic pellet: new industrial pre-production plastic nurdles, beached pre-production nurdles, and floating filters, known as biobeads, also retrieved from the environment. Our chemical analyses show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing industrial additives within the polymer matrix. In the light of the chemical contents of the leachates and other characteristics of the plastic particles used, we discuss the phenotypes observed during our study, which include abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis, redistribution of pigmented cells and embryo radialisation.},

  abstract={The relationship between the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the environment and exposure of biota needs to be better understood, particularly for vulnerable species and their habitats. In this study, we address the presence of microplastics in the riverine habitat of a threatened lamprey species (Lampetra sp.), both in habitats with protective interventions in place (designated as Special Areas of Conservation), and those without these protective interventions. By sampling both riverbed sediments and larval lamprey, we provide a direct comparison of the microplastic loadings in both, and insights into how knowledge of sediment loadings might predict biological uptake. Microplastic particles, analysed using micro-Fourier transform infrared (μFTIR) spectroscopy, were detected in all samples of lamprey larvae and paired sediment, ranging in abundance from 1.00 to 27.47 particles g−1 in dry lamprey gastrointestinal tract (GIT) tissue, and 0.40 to 105.41 particles g−1 in dry sediment. The most urbanised catchment exhibited the highest average microplastic particle count in both lamprey and sediment. Across sites, the microplastic abundance in lamprey GIT tissue was not correlated with that of the surrounding sediment, suggesting that either specific polymer types are retained or other factors such as larvae residence time within sediment patches may influence biological uptake. The most encountered polymer types in lamprey from their immediate habitat were polyurethane, polyamide, and cellulose acetate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document microplastic contamination of larval lamprey in-situ, contributing another potential stressor to the population status of a vulnerable species. This highlights where further research on the impacts of plastic contamination of freshwater environments is needed to aid conservation management of this ecologically important species.},
