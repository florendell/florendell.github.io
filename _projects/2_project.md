Effective science communication is a core principle that has always been incredibly important to me. I have developed relationships with local stakeholders in marine plastic pollution and conservation, and recognise the benefit of working closely to achieve common goals. In May 2018 I was successful in receiving a small grant to work with and develop the interdisciplinary Sail Against Plastic Team, at the University of Exeter, Penryn Campus. The funding allowed me to contribute funds for scientific expenses to undertake microplastic research on this island of Spitsbergen, South West Svalbard. The project 'Sail Against Plastic: A collaborative sailing expedition investigating and unveiling unseen pollution in the Arctic ocean', involved a diverse  group of passionate scientists, environmentalists, photographers, artists and videographers. Brought together through a shared love of the ocean and protecting the natural world, we utilised our collective skills to raise awareness of the hidden threats our oceans are facing.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
