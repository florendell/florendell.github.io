Effective science communication is a core principle that has always been incredibly important to me. I have developed relationships with local stakeholders in marine plastic pollution and conservation, and recognise the benefit of working closely to achieve common goals. 

<p> In May 2018 I was successful in receiving a grant to work with and develop the interdisciplinary Sail Against Plastic Team, at the University of Exeter, Penryn Campus. The funding allowed me to contribute funds for a collaborative scientific expenses to undertake microplastic research on this island of Spitsbergen, South West Svalbard. The project 'Sail Against Plastic: A collaborative sailing expedition investigating and unveiling unseen pollution in the Arctic ocean', involved a diverse  group of passionate scientists, environmentalists, photographers, artists and videographers. Brought together through a shared love of the ocean and protecting the natural world, we utilised our collective skills to raise awareness of the hidden threats our oceans are facing.

 Through community events, presentations, workshops, beach cleans, film screenings and talks we as a team helped to bring A Message from the Arctic to the UK.

As a team we contributed to the 'Invisible World's' Exhibition at The Eden Project, which included giving a presentation of the expedition and educating children and adults on ‘unseen pollutants’, including what actions they can do to reduce their plastic footprint.
