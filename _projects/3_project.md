To effectively monitor the behaviour of ammocetes in laboratory aquaria, with minimal disturbance, a video surveillance system was set up adopting the use of Raspberry Pis and infrared cameras. This low-cost system allowed the any emergence and burrowing behaviour from the sediment during both the day and night hours, using both video and image time-lapse. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi set up allows the detection of larvae to be automated, removing human bias and the need for extended periods of time to monitor the video.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
