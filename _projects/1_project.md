    This project gave me a strong appreciation for the importance of senstive life stages and understanding the impacts of novel contmaintes on these crucial time points.

ASSEMBLE Plus Transnational Access Programme
Awarded funding together with Eva Jimenez-Guri to complete the
project titled ‘The effects of microplastics on the development of sea
urchins (P. lividus)’ at the Station Zoologica Anton Dohrn – Naples.

**Plastics and the Hidden Majority: Conservation Implications for a Threatened UK Freshwater Fish**
Final year of PhD research investigating microplastic contamination presence and impacts on lamprey, supervised by Dr Colin Bull. All data collection to finish by June 2022, with the remaining data sets to be analysed. Broad understading of envionmental pollutants in UK rivers, environmental sampling, chemical and enzymatic digestions, micro-FTIR, data analysis in RStudio, analysis using Raspberry Pis, developmental toxicity.
